# Lab: Keras Traffic Sign Classification




We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of building and training a Traffic Sign Classification network with Keras.


## Instructions

1. Launch the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb`
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook


Since this is a self-assesd lab, you can view the solution by running the `traffic-sign-classification-with-keras-solution.ipynb` notebook. Make sure you're only running one notebook at a time.
